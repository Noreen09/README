## Fundamentals of Generative AI - Assignment 03

# Compound AI Systems:
Compound AI Systems are advanced frameworks that integrate multiple AI models, tools, or agents to address complex tasks that require diverse capabilities. Rather than relying on a single model to handle every requirement, compound systems combine the strengths of various components to achieve higher adaptability and problem-solving power. These systems can orchestrate several models that handle different functions, such as image recognition, language processing, and decision-making, all working together in a cohesive manner to complete multifaceted tasks.

# AI Agents:
AI Agents are autonomous software programs designed to carry out specific tasks or objectives in a way that simulates independent decision-making. An AI agent operates by taking input from its environment, processing that information, and acting based on predefined instructions, learned patterns, or real-time decisions. Often, agents are used for applications like data analysis, customer service, or automation, and they can adjust their actions according to the changing context within their operational environment, enabling them to work effectively on their own or within larger systems.

# The Relationship Between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents:
The Relationship Between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents is collaborative and complementary. In many cases, compound AI systems leverage multiple AI agents to manage distinct parts of a task, where each agent plays a specialized role, contributing to the system’s overall goal. By using different agents with unique functions, compound AI systems achieve enhanced flexibility and task-specific precision. This enables compound systems to handle complex, multi-step workflows that require the distinct contributions of various AI agents, allowing the system as a whole to solve complex problems more efficiently.

# Fine-Tuning vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
Fine-Tuning vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) represents two distinct strategies for optimizing AI models. Fine-tuning involves updating a pre-trained model with task-specific data to improve its accuracy and adaptability for a particular application, effectively tailoring the model’s performance. In contrast, RAG incorporates an external retrieval mechanism that dynamically gathers relevant data from a knowledge base or database to provide real-time context to a pre-trained model, rather than modifying the model itself. This approach allows RAG to deliver contextually enriched responses without the need for additional training, making it suitable for applications requiring up-to-date information without retraining the model frequently.
